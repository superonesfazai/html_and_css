    <h1>Fun in the Pond</h1>
    <p><a href="pond.mov"><img src="projector.gif" alt="Pond Video" style="border-style:none; float:left; padding:12px" /></a> Michael's backyard pond is not only a fun hobby but also an ongoing home improvement project that is both creative and relaxing. He has numerous fish in the pond, all Koi from various places as far as Japan, Israel, and Australia. Although they don't bark, purr, or fetch anything other than food, these fish are his pets, and good ones at that. Click <a href="pond.mov">here</a> or on the animated graphic on the left to see a movie clip of some fish in the pond.</p>
